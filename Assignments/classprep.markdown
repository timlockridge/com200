I will ask you to create an Evernote notebook and share it with me. You will store your class preparation materials in this notebook, including:

* **A brief summary** of the reading(s). Consider your summary a way to answer questions such as: What is the main point? Why does it matter? So what?
* **A few important quotations** (these quotes can be as short as one sentence or as long as one paragraph) from the reading.
* **Two or three questions** about the reading. *A note about questions: These should not be yes/no questions. Your questions will be used as prompts for our classroom discussions & activities, and they should thusly extend and reconsider the readings.*

You are free to include additional materials in your notebook, such as:

* Pictures/scans of annotated pages
* Clippings of webpages that connect to/are relevant to the topics
* Other supplementary materials

These materials are due before every class in which there is an assigned reading. Your preparation will be assessed according to the following criteria:

* **3 points**: Prep contains all required items (summary, quotes, questions) and shows evidence of active reading and thoughtful consideration of the arguments.
* **2 points**: Prep contains all required items (summary, quotes, questions), but reveals a hasty or surface-level reading.
* **1 points**: Prep is attempted but is incomplete.
* **0 points**: No prep.

I will assess your prep materials at 11am on the day of class. Any materials added to the notebook after 11am will not be included in the assessment.
