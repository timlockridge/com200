#COM 200 Communications Theory and Practice

## Course Description

It is an overused cliche that we live in a digital world. But this cliche also points to a certain truth: communication is now primarily digital. Indeed it would be possible to argue that all research, writing, and communication is digital, or at least structured by the digital landscape. The ability to write in digital spaces, research online, and participate in these evolving social communities has become a critical 21st century knowledge. In this class we will not only study these evolving digital literacies, but actively practice them. This course serves as one of the foundational courses for Communication majors and minors.

## Required Texts

There is one required text for this class:

* *Net Smart: How to Thrive Online.* Howard Rheingold. ISBN 0262017458

In addition you will also need your own domain and hosting. (Many of the things we will do in class require you have your own domain and hosting.) We will cover the details of this in class.


## Course Overview & Learning Objectives

This course is built around one semester-long project in which you will be the class subject expert for a particular topic. You will choose a subject of interest to you and (following Rheingold's model) collect, curate, filter, and write--building and contributing to a Personal Learning Network. You will also explore numerous technologies (RSS, Web Capturing/Archiving, Social Bookmarking, Digital Annotation, Web Workflows, and more) and search for ways to evaluate, manage, and make sense of a *large* amount of digital text. You won't do this alone, however, as much of our coursework is focused on collaboration. We will use class time to discuss, learn, create, curate, and write as a group.

Specifically, upon completion of this course, students will:

* Become familiar with digital media and how they operate
* Develop collaborative learning skills
* Gain experience with a range of digital tools for capturing, curating, producing, and transmitting media
* Build and participate in a Personal Learning Network
* Understand the larger issues and debates shaping the transformation of the media landscape and more importantly the society at large

## Class Requirements

The final grade will be determined by performance on the following projects. The specific details of each project will be included on the project’s assignment sheet and discussed in class. *You must complete each assignment to earn a passing grade!* 

**Digital Writing Project** (50%): You will study, in great depth, a specific topic, building a blog and using several digital tools to filter and curate information related to your topic. This project asks you to learn how to write online, how to manage many streams of information, and how to connect with and engage readers. Although the whole of this assignment adds up to half of the semester's points, it is built from many smaller assignments and weekly check-ins. (See the [assignment sheet](#) for more details.) These assignments will vary both in terms of length and content, but expect to work on this every week. (Expect to spend 3-4 hours a week on this.)

**Presentations** (15%): During the final weeks of the course, students will work in pairs to evaluate one of the digital platforms and tools we did not cover in class and present their findings to the class. (Expect to spend 10-12 hours during the final weeks of the course on this final project.)

**Reflection Essays** (15%) You will be asked to write several short pieces throughout the semester reflecting on your engagement with the digital tools and spaces we experiment with in class. (Expect to spend 6-8 hours over the course of the semester on these.) 

**Digital Media** (10%): Throughout the course we will be experimenting with multiple digital platforms. (Expect to spend approximately 1 hour a week on this.)

**Informal Projects, Class Prep, & Assessment** (10%): While I don't include *participation* as an assessment category, your performance in preparing for class and in completing informal classroom projects will be evaluated. For example, you will--through Evernote (or a similar service)--share with me your reading notes and class prep materials. I will periodically check these, and the thoroughness of your preparation will contribute to this grade category. During the first week of class we will discuss the specifics of this evaluation method. Additionally, if there's widespread evidence of hasty reading/prep, I will administer pop quizzes. Should those occur they will contribute to this assessment category. (Expect to spend 3 hours a week in class and roughly 3-4 hours a week reading for class.)

## Policies

### Attendance, Attention, & Participation

As this course is highly interactive and practice/discussion-driven, your success is absolutely tethered to your presence and participation. The course will move quickly, and each successive meeting will build upon the concepts of the previous. Missing a class puts you at a serious disadvantage in terms of the larger semester arc.

Please come to class on time, prepared, having completed the assigned reading and writing, and ready to contribute to class discussions, to listen seriously and respectfully to the thoughts of others, and to participate in all in-class activities. Lateness is also unacceptable; if you arrive late to class or leave early, you can be marked as absent. Only three absences are permitted, and these should be used for illness or emergencies (i.e. this does not mean three absences plus absences for illness etc.). Each absence after your third will result in a .25 deduction from your final grade--making, for example, a 3.25 a 3.0. After the sixth absence, you will fail the class (a grade of FA). Your primary responsibility is to be in class and fully present.

Beyond mere presence, however, a successful course requires student participation. Students are expected to come to class on time, prepared, having completed the assigned reading and writing, and ready to contribute to class discussions, to listen seriously and respectfully to the thoughts of others, and to participate in all in-class activities. I strongly urge you to attend every class, as most of the work done in class is necessary for successful completion of the course. 


### Course Website

The course website for this class can be found at [TBA](#). You should get in the habit of checking this regularly as I will post suggestions and thoughts about the readings here, as well as links to other things that might interest the class. The syllabus can be found here as well, and any changes to the syllabus will be posted here.

### A Note on Technology

Because at its core this class is about how technology changes our culture, we will necessarily engage with a range of computer tools and web based applications. You do not need any prior skill; you merely need a willingness to engage and learn. A majority of the tools we will be using in class are web-based, and you will not need any special software. While we have lab computers on which you can work, you will probably find it easier to use your own computer--as many of the services we will use have plugins or extensions that connect to the browser. Bringing in your own computer and configuring it during class and lab sessions might save you time later.

Should you need to use additional materials: In the IT office in the basement of Merion Hall (directly below our classroom), COM students have access to a variety of audio/visual equipment. Check out time is 48 hours.

### Digital Etiquette

Many of the assignments throughout the semester will require participation in online spaces. Students should work to preserve the same atmosphere of respect and consideration that occurs in the classroom. Disagreements may arise and consensus is not always possible (indeed disagreements are productive). However, name calling, harassing, flaming, trolling etc. is antithetical to the goals of this course.

### How to Reach me

Please feel free to drop by my office to ask questions, offer concerns, or just say hi. Before dropping by, I encourage you to schedule an appointment at [timlockridge.com/cal](http://www.timlockridge.com/cal). This is especially true if you need extended help: Schedule an appointment or send me an email and let me know when you plan to stop by. For short queries, you can message me (either via direct message or a mention) on Twitter: [@timlockridge](http://www.twitter.com/timlockridge) or via Google Chat (timlockridge@gmail.com).

When emailing me, keep in mind that--depending on the day and email volume--it might take me 48 hours to respond. If I haven’t responded to you in 48 hours, please email me again. I won’t be offended or bothered: Things can get lost in digital transit, and I want to make sure your questions are answered in a timely fashion.

My office hours are [TBA]. My office is Merion Hall 186.


### Grading

Specific grading criteria for each assignment will be discussed in class, but in general: I will evaluate your work on a 4.0 grading scale, where an outstanding performance yields a 4.0 (an A), good performance yields a 3.0 (a B), fair performance yields a 2.0 (a C), and work that simply meets the minimum requirements yields a 1.0 (a D). I will use an assignment-specific framework to evaluate each project, and each of those frameworks will be detailed on the assignment sheet and available to you before you submit your final draft.

Unless it is cleared with me before the deadline, late work will be penalized at 1 grade point per day late. So an A assignment becomes a B if submitted a day late, etc. If you feel that your project is going awry or that you won’t be able to meet a deadline, please contact me before the deadline. Depending on the project and the context, I can sometimes help with deadline pressure--if contacted in advance. After the deadline, the penalty stands.

The semester grade breakdown (based on a percentage of total available points) follows:

 A | B |  C |  D |  F |
 ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
 x | B+: 89-87% | C+: 79-77% | D+: 69-67% | x |
 A: 100-94% | B: 86-84% | C: 76-74% | D: 66-64% | F: 59=0% |
 A-: 93-90% | B-: 83-80% | C-: 73-70% | D-: 63-60% | x |

### University Policies

**Academic Honesty**: There are a few basic rules regarding the use of information in this course:

* If you use the language of your source, you must quote it exactly, enclose it in quotation marks, and cite the source--even (and especially) in your blog posts. This is called a direct quotation. A direct quotation is either enclosed in quotation marks or indented on the page. If you omit part of the wording, use an ellipsis (three periods, four if necessary for punctuation to indicate the omission). In any case, several words in succession taken from another source constitute direct quotation and must be acknowledged.
* A paraphrase employs source material by restating an idea in an entirely new form that is original in both sentence structure and word choice. Paraphrased material also needs to be cited--either by parenthetical citation, in-sentence attribution, or hyperlink. Taking the basic structure from a source and substituting a few words is an unacceptable paraphrase and may be construed as plagiarism. Creating a new sentence by merging the wording of two or more sources is also plagiarism. The penalty for plagiarism is an automatic Fail for this class and a letter of notification to the Committee on Discipline.
* When attaching or inserting any type of media (image, sound, etc) into your work, that media should be used and cited in a manner compliant with the work’s copyright or creative commons license. In most instances, you should seek out media that has a creative commons license or has been released to the public domain.

In short: If you use media, information, or ideas that are not yours and not common knowledge, you must cite a source. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the [University's Academic Honesty Policy](http://hawkcentral.sju.edu/ics/support/kbanswer.asp?deptID=16171&task=knowledge&questionID=95).

**Disability Support**: In accordance with state and federal laws, the University will make reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. For those who have or think that you may have a disability requiring an accommodation (learning, physical, psychological) should contact Services for Students with Disabilities, Room G10, Bellarmine, 610-660-1774 (voice) or 610-660-1620 (TTY) as early as possible in the semester for additional information and so that an accommodation, if appropriate, can be made in a timely manner. You will be required to provide current (within 3 years) documentation of the disability.

For a more detailed explanation of the University’s accommodation process, as well as the programs and services offered to students with disabilities, please see the [Student Resources Page](www.sju.edu/studentlife/studentresources/sess/ssd). If you have any difficulty accessing the information on-line, please contact Services for Students with Disabilities at the telephone numbers above.
